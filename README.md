# Yale CPSC 201: Introduction to Computer Science (Spring 2024)

This repository is designed to be a valuable resource for individuals interested in engaging with the course materials for CPSC 201: Introduction to Computer Science, as offered in Spring 2024 through the Yale Zoo website. It provides a comprehensive overview of the course structure, including a detailed schedule that outlines readings and homework assignments in the sequence they were originally presented.

## Overview

### Course Description
Introduction to the concepts, techniques, and applications of computer science. Topics include computer systems (the design of computers and their languages); theoretical foundations of computing (computability, complexity, algorithm design); and artificial intelligence (the organization of knowledge and its representation for efficient search). Examples stress the importance of different problem-solving methods.

## Textbook
- [The Racket Guide](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/): A description of Racket for people with previous programming experience
- [How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/) (Optional): An introduction to programming using Racket written by its inventors. It assumes no programming background.

## Schedule

The following table is an aggregation of the reading assignments, homework assignments, and the lecture schedule from the [course's web page](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs201/) on the Yale Zoo website. Homework assignments appear on the data they are assigned.

Bear in mind these dates are from the Spring 2024 offering of the course. Dates are still being updated as the class is currently being taught this semester.
