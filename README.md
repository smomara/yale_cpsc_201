# Yale CPSC 201: Introduction to Computer Science (Spring 2024)

## Overview

### Course Description
Introduction to the concepts, techniques, and applications of computer science. Topics include computer systems (the design of computers and their languages); theoretical foundations of computing (computability, complexity, algorithm design); and artificial intelligence (the organization of knowledge and its representation for efficient search). Examples stress the importance of different problem-solving methods.

## Textbook
- [The Racket Guide](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/): A description of Racket for people with previous programming experience
- [How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/) (Optional): An introduction to programming using Racket written by its inventors. It assumes no programming background.
