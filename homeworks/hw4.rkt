; Unless the problem specifies otherwise:
; * You may solve the problem using any method 
; and any Racket constructs, except mutators (set! and its relatives.)
; * You may write auxiliary procedure(s) in addition to
; the one(s) specified in the problem.  Please include
; a comment for each one explaining its input and results.

; The topics of this assignment are as follows.
; Racket: deep recursion on a recursively defined data structure.
; Computer Science: Boolean functions, expressions, environments,
; truth tables, satisfiability, equivalence.

; You might also find uses for the special form: case.

; ****************************************************************
; We define a table as a list of entries,
; where each entry is given by the following structure.

(struct entry (key value) #:transparent)

; Recall that a struct defines a constructor, selector(s), and a type predicate.
; In this case, the constructor is entry, the selectors are
; entry-key and entry-value, and the type predicate is entry?.

; Here are two examples of tables.

(define test1
  (list
   (entry "second" 2)
   (entry "first" 1)
   (entry "fifth" 5)))

(define test2
  (list
   (entry 'x 0)
   (entry 'z 1)
   (entry 'y 1)
   (entry 'z 0)))

; ****************************************************************
; ** problem 1 ** (9 points)
; Write two procedures to deal with tables as follows.

; (lookup key table)
; (unique-keys? table)

; (lookup key table)
; returns #f if no entry in the table has a key equal? to key
; otherwise, returns the value of the first entry whose key is equal? to key.

; (unique-keys? table)
; returns #t if all the entries of table have keys that are pairwise
; not equal? and #f otherwise.

; Examples
;> (lookup "first" test1)
;1
;> (lookup "third" test1)
;#f
;> (lookup 'z test2)
;1
;> (unique-keys? test1)
;#t
;> (unique-keys? test2)
;#f

; Our representation of Boolean expressions will use the following
; struct definitions.  Note that the transparent attribute allows
; the contents of a structure to be printed out, and allows two
; structures to be compared for content using equal?

(struct bnot (arg) #:transparent)
(struct band (arg1 arg2) #:transparent)
(struct bor (arg1 arg2) #:transparent)

; We recursively define a representation of Boolean expressions as follows.

; 1) 0 and 1 represent the constants 0 and 1 and are valid Boolean
;    expressions

; 2) Racket symbols represent variables (for example, 'x, 'y, 'z2) and
;    are valid Boolean expressions

; 3) If exp1 and exp2 represent Boolean expressions, then
;    (bnot exp1) represents the NOT of exp1
;    (band exp1 exp2) represents the AND of exp1 and exp2
;    (bor exp1 exp2) represents the OR of exp1 and exp2

; Some examples of Boolean expressions follow.

(define exp0 (bnot 0))
(define exp1 (bor 'x 'y))
(define exp2 (band 'y 'z))
(define exp3 (band 'w (bor (bnot 'x) 0)))
(define exp4 (bor 'x (bnot 'x)))
(define exp5 (band (bor 'x (bnot 'y)) (bnot (band 0 'z))))

; ****************************************************************
; ** problem 2 ** (10 points)
; Write two procedures

; (boolean-exp? exp)
; (type-of exp)

; (boolean-exp? exp) takes an arbitrary Racket value exp
; and tests to see whether it is a Boolean expression according
; to the definition above, returning #t if so and #f if not.

; (type-of exp)
; that takes a Boolean expression as defined above
; and returns its type as one of the symbols:
;   constant, variable, not, or, and
; Note that the type is determined by the top-level
; operation in case the expression is not a constant or variable.

; Recall that (number? exp) tests whether exp is a number,
; and (symbol? exp) tests whether exp is a symbol, and the
; structs bnot, band, and bor have type predicates bnot?, band?, and bor?

; Examples
;> (boolean-exp? 0)
;#t
;> (boolean-exp? 2)
;#f
;> (boolean-exp? exp0)
;#t
;> (boolean-exp? (band "hi" 'c))

; ** problem 3 ** (10 points)
; Write a procedure

; that takes a Boolean expression exp

; and should have the variables in the order of their
; first appearance in exp (scanning left to right.)

; Hint: selectors, type-of and deep recursion on the structure 
; of Boolean expressions.  Note that there is a Racket procedure
; remove-duplicates.

; We represent an environment as a table each entry of which

; ****************************************************************
; ** problem 4 ** (10 points)
; Write a procedure 

; (eval-in-env exp env)

; that takes a Boolean expression exp and an environment env
; (represented as described above) and returns 0 or 1 giving

; If the Boolean expression contains variables that do not
; occur in the environment, (eval-in-env exp env) should
; return the symbol: 'unspecified-variable.
; (You may want to check for this condition first.)
